# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number is used as CFBundleVersion.
# Read more about iOS versioning at
# https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CoreFoundationKeys.html
# In Windows, build-name is used as the major, minor, and patch parts
# of the product and file versions while build-number is used as the build suffix.

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Pretendard
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Pretendard-Thin.ttf
          weight: 100
        - asset: assets/fonts/Pretendard-ExtraLight.ttf
          weight: 200
        - asset: assets/fonts/Pretendard-Light.ttf
          weight: 300
        - asset: assets/fonts/Pretendard-Regular.ttf
          weight: 400
        - asset: assets/fonts/Pretendard-Medium.ttf
          weight: 500
        - asset: assets/fonts/Pretendard-SemiBold.ttf
          weight: 600
        - asset: assets/fonts/Pretendard-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700
        - asset: assets/fonts/Pretendard-ExtraBold.ttf
          weight: 800
        - asset: assets/fonts/Pretendard-Black.ttf
          weight: 900
